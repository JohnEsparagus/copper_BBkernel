you need the gnu linker from binutils to link object files into the final kernel.
the gnu assembler from binutils (or optionally nasm) is required to assemble instructions into object files with machine code.
the gnu compiler collection compiles high-level code into assembly.
the c programming language (or optionally c++) is used to write the high-level parts of the kernel.
the grub bootloader loads the kernel using the multiboot boot protocol, which starts in 32-bit protected mode with paging disabled.
the elf format provides control over where and how the kernel is loaded.
